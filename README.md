# LibGDX Project Setup (gdx-setup-ui)

Gdx-setup-ui is a **desktop application** made to ease the process of creating a new project with the (awesome) game library LibGDX.

Choose a title for your game, a package name and a directory, and you'll be set up in no time! No more headache configuring eveything [by hand](http://code.google.com/p/libgdx/wiki/ProjectSetupNew).

The application also lets you choose between additionnal **third-party libraries**. These libraries can be downloaded from the application, and their configuration in your projects are managed automatically (file decompression and classpath registration).
