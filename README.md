# LibGDX Project Setup (gdx-setup-ui)

Gdx-setup-ui is a **desktop application** made to ease the process of creating a new project with the (awesome) game library LibGDX.

LibGDX lets you deploy your game for various backends, such as Android, Windows, Linux, OS-X, web browsers (with WebGL) and maybe soon even iOS!
All of this comes at the price that a complex eclipse environment has to be set up, with many different projects.

Now, thanks to this tool, choose a title for your game, a package name and a directory, and **you'll be set up in no time**!
No more headache configuring eveything [by hand](http://code.google.com/p/libgdx/wiki/ProjectSetupNew).

The application also lets you choose between additionnal **third-party libraries**. These libraries can be downloaded from the application,
and their configuration in your projects are managed automatically (file decompression and classpath registration).

Since version 3, you can also very easily **update an existing project** with the latest version of LibGDX and the third-party libraries. You can even
add a new library to your project at any moment, or delete an existing one!
